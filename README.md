# pool

Simple pool game written in HTML and Javascript. Check out the hosted demo [here](http://www.devingray.com/pool).

# How to play

Click in the direction you intend for the ball to go and press space bar or edit through the values of the shot located on the lower left of the browser screen. Balls are removed from table whenever they go to one of the table holes, just like a pool game. Game ends when all balls have been removed from table. Please refrain from putting values too high as this might cause unexpected behaviour.
